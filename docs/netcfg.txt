NAME
====
netcfg -- start/stop/control network profiles

SYNOPSIS
========
netcfg [*options*]

netcfg **profile**

DESCRIPTION
===========
**netcfg** is used to configure and manage network connections via
profiles. It has pluggable support for a range of connection types, such
as wireless, ethernet, ppp. It is also capable of starting/stopping many
to one connections, that is, multiple connections within the same
profile, optionally with bonding.

It may be run at boot, by enabling the */etc/rc.d/net-profiles*
daemon in */etc/rc.conf* **DAEMONS** line. After boot time, it may
be used to start profiles, simply by passing only the profile name.

When run without options, netxfg **profile** is equivalent to *netcfg -u
profile*.
