# Wireless options reference
## Description
This connection method uses  wpa_supplicant to configure a wireless network connection. This connection uses the 'ethernet' connection after successful association and thus supports all of it's options. 

## Options
INTERFACE (required)
:   The wireless interface to configure
SECURITY (required for security of 'wep', 'wpa', 'wpa-configsection' or 'wpa-config')
:   One of 'wpa', 'wep', 'none', 'wpa-configsection' or 'wpa-config'. Defaults to 'none'. Old iwconfig based configuration code can be used with 'wep-old' and 'none-old'.
KEY (required for SECURITY of 'wpa' or 'wep' only)
:   Wireless encryption key. 
ESSID (this or AP is required)
:   Name of network to connect to.
AP (this or ESSID is required)
:   AP of the network to connect to.
TIMEOUT (optional)
:   Time to wait for association. Defaults to 15 seconds. 
SCAN (optional)
:   yes/no Scan for a wireless network rather than blindly attempting to connect. Hidden SSID networks do not appear in a scan. 
IWCONFIG (optional)
:   Arguments to pass to iwconfig before attempting to configure the connection. For example, BSSID.

### WPA options  
WPA_CONF (for SECURITY of 'wpa-config' only)
:   Path to wpa_supplicant configuration. Defaults to '/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf'
WPA_OPTS 
:   Extra arguments for wpa_supplicant not specified otherwise.  
WPA_GROUP
:   Group that has authority to configure wpa_supplicant via it's control interface. Used in any configuration that is generated by netcfg.
WPA_COUNTRY (optional, nl80211 based drivers)
:   The country where the device will be used. This allows wpa_supplicant to enforce any local regulatory limitations and will allow all appropriate channels/frequencies for your device.
WPA_DRIVER (optional)
:   A comma-separated list of wpa_supplicant driver interfaces to try. Defaults to 'nl80211,wext'.
 
### rfkill (Radio Kill Switch) options 
RFKILL 
:   hard/soft A switch with physical on/off state that cannot be controlled via software is considered a 'hard' switch. Any switch that can be controlled via software is considered 'soft'. 
RFKILL_NAME
:   Some switches sysfs entries are not linked with the interface. To match them up, configure the name from /sys/class/rfkill/rfkillX/name here so that netcfg can identify which to control.
